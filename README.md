- 👋 Hi, I’m @aysafetyokc. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... crafting the next generation of safety training, reaching out to the fifth of Americans that have low level English literacy or are functionally   illiterate.
- This will achieve the goal of giving that population a safe, good paying job that contributes to society and gives them a career path with an in demand future. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... how to start my own business, handling all of a construction business' safety needs. 
- Whether that is keeping records of safety inspections, performing training and curriculum development, job hazard assesments, etc. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... a website to convey my message and achieve the established goal. This will later evolve into a platform that will allow the automation of routine safety related tasks. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... aysafetyokc@gmail.com
